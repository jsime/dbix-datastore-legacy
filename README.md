DBIx::DataStore

IMPORTANT NOTICE

This is the legacy release of DBIx::DataStore and will not see future
(non-critical bug fix) releases. It is being published for the sole
purpose of easing the maintenance of existing installations.

Future versions of this module will make attempts to maintain as much
backwards compatibility as possible, but there are no guarantees that
every feature or method will carry over unchanged from the user
perspective.

This code has been in production use at multiple companies for about
a decade and is considered pretty (though not perfectly) stable. You
are welcome to make use of it, in the form presented here, in your
own projects. But do not submit feature requests or support requests
for this version. Only critical, show-stopping security and bug fix
requests will be reviewed.
