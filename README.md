# DBIx::DataStore

## IMPORTANT NOTICE

This is the legacy release of DBIx::DataStore and will not see future
(non-critical bug fix) releases. It is being published for the sole
purpose of easing the maintenance of existing installations.

Future versions of this module will make attempts to maintain as much
backwards compatibility as possible, but there are no guarantees that
every feature or method will carry over unchanged from the user
perspective.

This code has been in production use at multiple companies for almost
fifteen years and is considered pretty (though not perfectly) stable.
You are welcome to make use of it, in the form presented here, in your
own projects. Feature requests for this version will likely be met with
a pretty low priority, and development of new applications or libraries
with it is not encouraged. Critical security and bug fix requests will
be reviewed.
